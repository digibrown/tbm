The darlings or the bastards of Sydney subversive culture, masters of dancefloor mayhem. and troubadours of our troubled times. From the Opera House to a street corner near you, Waiting for Guinness, a rhapsodic renegade a rambunctious hand grenade..

Since their busking beginnings in Sydney, their self-titled debut album (2003), and follow-up releases "The Show" (2004), and “Friend or Foe” (2007), **Waiting for Guinness** have grown in size and popularity, gaining a reputation for truly anarchic live performances.

 

They have played at major festivals across Australia including St Kilda (VIC), Port Fairy (VIC), repeat appearances at Woodford Folk Festival (QLD), the National Folk Festival, Cockatoo Island, Peats Ridge, Adelaide Fringe Festival, Newtown Festival, Fairbridge Festival (WA), Mullumbimby Festival, and have been invited to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Montreux Jazz Festival 2005 and Switzerland’s International Buskers Festival 2005.

 

WFG have produced sell-out theatrical/vaudeville shows at the Sydney Opera House Studio, and toured nationally with the dance production “Night Café” with Dance North in .

 

With its wealth of remarkable musicians and an explosive live show, **Waiting for Guinness** continues to delight audiences around the country with its sumptuous and diverse music.

 

_“Serving up their idiosyncratic blend of tortured jazz, gypsy blues, gallows humour and Balkans boogie, Waiting for Guinness are not simply excellent theatrical musicians, singers and songwriters, they are pure Entertainers!”_  

_(Stephen Davenport, The Program, 2006)._
