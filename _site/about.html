<p><strong>Galas Organic Kitchen Short Compositions</strong></p>

<p>Here’s a series of short compositions, created for the lovely <a href="http://www.galasorganickitchen.com/">Galas Organic Kitchen</a>, as speed composing and producing exercises. They were all created in between 1 and 4 hours of receiving the video, often while I was on tour using random kitchen implements or found instruments.</p>
