<p>Extreme instrumentalism meets cutting edge electronic manipulation. The Gypsy Dub Sound System (GDSS) is filled with funky dubby and juicey beats featuring Trevor Brown on sax/electronic/bouzouki; Veren Grigorov on violin; and Dirk Kruithof on Guitar.</p>

<p>From the streets of Barcelona and Paris to warehouse parties in Sydney and Melbourne, to residencies at The Famous Spiegeltent, to headlining at festivals, such as the Sydney Festival and Woodford to the Sydney Opera House, the members of GDSS play with passion and humour, bending genres to breaking point then snapping into rip-snorting renditions of classic and surprising tunes played with virtuosic precision.GDSS has played at many festivals including, Sydney Festival, Womad (Closing Party), Corinbank Festival, Festival Of the Winds, and Aroma Coffee Festival at the Rocks, Sydney.</p>
