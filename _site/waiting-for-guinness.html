<p>Since their busking beginnings in Sydney, their self-titled debut album (2003), and follow-up releases “The Show” (2004), and “Friend or Foe” (2007), <strong>Waiting for Guinness</strong> have grown in size and popularity, gaining a reputation for truly anarchic live performances.</p>

<p>WFG have produced sell-out theatrical/vaudeville shows at the Sydney Opera House Studio, and toured nationally with the dance production “Night Café” with Dance North in .</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With its wealth of remarkable musicians and an explosive live show, <strong>Waiting for Guinness</strong> continues to delight audiences around the country with its sumptuous and diverse music.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>“Serving up their idiosyncratic blend of tortured jazz, gypsy blues, gallows humour and Balkans boogie, Waiting for Guinness are not simply excellent theatrical musicians, singers and songwriters, they are pure Entertainers!”</em>  </p>

<p><em>(Stephen Davenport, The Program, 2006).</em></p>
