**Galas Organic Kitchen Short Compositions**

Here's a series of short compositions, created for the lovely [Galas Organic Kitchen](http://www.galasorganickitchen.com/), as speed composing and producing exercises. They were all created in between 1 and 4 hours of receiving the video, often while I was on tour using random kitchen implements or found instruments.
