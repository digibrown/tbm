I Sognaturi have just completed a European tour in 2014, playing in Sicily, Napoli, Venezia, Arezzo, and then were featured artists at the [sedam dana stvaranja](https://www.facebook.com/sedamdanastvaranja?fref=photo) in Croatia and then were resident artists at the Patyolat Theatre in the heart of Budapest.

They are currently in Australia in January and February in 2015, starting at the famous Cygnet Folk Festival in Tasmania.

[](http://www.trevorbrownmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vero-pic-.jpg)We invite you to join us, singer/accordionist/Folklorist Veronica Canale and Multi-instumentalist Trevor Brown, in to the serenely beautiful and strangely quirky world of Venezia and Beyond. Be inchanted by songs of intoxicated ghosts at the Venice Carnivale and mesmeric Sardinian lullabies, collected by Veronica in her travels and complemented by Trevor's weird and wonderful arrangements.

A delightfully sumptuous collaboration between Italian singer, accordionist, folklorist and teacher, Veronica Canale, and Australian composer, performer , multi-instrumentalist Trevor Brown. Veronica specializes in collecting and performing the exquisitely quirky music of her home city, Venice , is also a virtuosic accordionist, researcher of Italian traditional songs and lullabies. She has also performed and collaborated with many international circus and theatre acts, as well as creating work for the Venice Biennale. Trevor, a virtuosic multi-instrumentalist and is a prolific composer and masterful improviser, lending his talents to an array of diverse projects around the country and the World, from circuses to symphonies , from Darwin to Dakar. His ability to blend classical /folk /electronic to experimental compliments the sometimes serene, other times strident or humorous music of Veronica.

Vero and Trevor shared a warehouse in in the grotty streets of Chippendale in Sydney 10 years ago and started playing together then, and they've furthered the project when Trevor has traveled to Italy, to play with her in some quintessentially crazy Italian festivals, in Venice, Lido and Abruzzo. In 2013 they toured to Istria in Croatia and in 2014 , are invited to Budapest to perform with some luminaries of the Hungarian folk and world music scene as well as touring Italy, Croatia, and France. 2014-15 will be Veronica's first return to Australia since leaving in 2005 and whilst in Europe this year, they will tour and record a new album.
